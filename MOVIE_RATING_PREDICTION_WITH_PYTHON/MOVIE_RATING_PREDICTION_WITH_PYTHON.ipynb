    "## **Background Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDb India Movies dataset is a curated collection of Indian movies listed on IMDb, capturing essential information such as titles, ratings, genres, and the individuals involved in each film (actors, directors). The dataset offers a rich opportunity for exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend detection, and insights into the Indian film industry over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends in ratings, duration, votes, genres, and roles of actors/directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key patterns and trends such as top-rated movies, most active directors, and yearly performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build predictive models to understand factors influencing movie ratings or popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "This dataset provides a comprehensive view of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evolution of the Indian film industry over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Audience preferences, gauged via votes and ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Influence of movie duration and genre on viewer perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trends related to popular actors and directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is an excellent foundation for beginner to intermediate projects in data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Domain\n",
    "The dataset opens up multiple areas of inquiry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time series trends: How have ratings or the number of movies changed over the years?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact analysis: Does movie duration or genre affect its IMDb rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Popularity vs. quality: Do high vote counts correlate with higher ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Industry contributions: Which directors and actors have contributed the most to Indian cinema?\n",
    "\n",
    "- These questions can be answered through:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., handling nulls in actors and genres).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Aggregation and grouping operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Building regression or classification models (e.g., predicting high vs low-rated movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- Missing data: Many null values in actor, director, and genre columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data inconsistency: Genre, duration, and names might have inconsistent formats or typos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple entries: A movie may be listed under multiple genres or actors, requiring careful parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced popularity: Some movies may have a high number of votes but poor ratings (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias in ratings: Ratings might be skewed by popularity or recency effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions\n",
    "- What is the trend of movie ratings across different years?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which year had the best average rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does movie duration impact the rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the top 10 movies by rating per year and overall?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which directors have directed the most movies?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which actors frequently appear across top-rated movies?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What genres are most commonly associated with high ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are more movies being released over the years?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we predict the success (high rating) of a movie based on features like duration, genre, and director?\n",
