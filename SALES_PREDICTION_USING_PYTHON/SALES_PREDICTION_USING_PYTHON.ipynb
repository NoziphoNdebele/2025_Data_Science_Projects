    "## **Background Context**\n",
    "Advertising is a critical component of a company’s marketing strategy. Understanding the impact of different advertising channels on product sales allows businesses to allocate their marketing budgets more effectively. In this project, we analyze the relationship between TV advertising and sales using a simple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "This project aims to build a simple linear regression model to predict product sales based on TV advertising spending. By quantifying the relationship between advertising investment and resulting sales, we aim to offer data-driven insights that can support decision-making in marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "Analyzing the relationship between advertising and sales is beneficial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the effectiveness of TV advertising as a marketing channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing a baseline for predictive modeling and linear regression in business analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrating how simple linear regression can be used to interpret real-world relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helping marketers and business analysts optimize advertising budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis serves as a practical example of applying linear regression to real-world business data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Domain\n",
    "The dataset includes advertising expenditures across three media types—TV, Radio, and Newspaper—and corresponding product sales. For this project, we focus on TV advertising as the sole independent variable to predict Sales using simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether there is a statistically significant linear relationship between TV ad spend and Sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much of the variation in Sales can be explained by the TV advertising budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- Linearity Assumption: Ensuring a linear relationship between TV advertising and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residual Analysis: Verifying the assumptions of linear regression (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Limitation: Only using TV as the predictor while ignoring other potentially relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting/Underfitting: Balancing model complexity and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions\n",
    "- Is there a strong linear relationship between TV advertising and sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the slope of the regression line, and how should it be interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much of the variance in sales is explained by TV ad spend?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we reliably use TV advertising as a predictor of future sales?"
